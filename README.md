# 🏦 Freddie Mac REMIC (CMO) Cash Flow Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes the cash flow structure and performance of a **Freddie Mac REMIC (Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduit)** using historical mortgage-backed security data. The goal is to model tranche-level cash flows, prepayment behavior, and timing risk across different bond classes.

The analysis is conducted in Excel and focuses on understanding how principal and interest are allocated under a REMIC waterfall structure.

## Problem Statement
REMIC and CMO structures redistribute mortgage cash flows across tranches with different risk profiles. Investors must understand:
- Prepayment risk
- Extension and contraction risk
- Average life and timing of cash flows
- How waterfall rules affect each tranche

This project evaluates those risks using a structured cash flow model.

## Data
- **Issuer:** Freddie Mac  
- **Instrument:** REMIC / CMO
- **Format:** Excel-based cash flow model
- **Inputs include:**
  - Mortgage balance
  - Coupon rates
  - Scheduled principal
  - Prepayments
  - Interest payments
  - Tranche definitions

## Methodology
1. Model monthly mortgage cash flows
2. Apply REMIC waterfall rules to distribute:
   - Interest
   - Scheduled principal
   - Prepaid principal
3. Track tranche-level balances over time
4. Analyze timing and cash flow behavior under the structure

Key metrics analyzed:
- Tranche balances
- Principal paydown patterns
- Interest cash flows
- Weighted Average Life (WAL)
- Sensitivity to prepayment assumptions

- Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS)
- REMIC / CMO structures
- Prepayment risk (CPR / PSA)
- Cash flow waterfalls
- Tranche prioritization
